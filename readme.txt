= Privacy-Friendly Plugin Design =
Social Plugins and especially the Facebook Like Button have received many criticism in European countries since they allow social networks to track user behaviour even if a user does not have signed up with the social network.

This follow me social widget plugin does not make use of any external resources (e.g. Facebook, Twitter or Google+ SDK).
